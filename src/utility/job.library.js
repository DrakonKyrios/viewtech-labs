#p{My next project was working with the university’s Project Manager in creating a 
student application in Angular & Java & PostgreSQL stack. My first responsibility 
was to ensure the UX & UI Designer’s mocks were implemented and matching the 
design, though some ancillary responsibilities included in helping the team 
adopt agile principles, help run some agile ceremonies, helping team members 
implement E2E with Cypress, and helping our backend team with performance 
optimization and refactoring. Towards the end of the project new obstacles 
developed with Shibboleth and Salesforce Lightning which required the
frontend to be refactored to use Angular Universal for server-side rendering 
which I was able to accomplish before the contract ended.}
#p{My last project dealt strictly with the Java backend and MSSQL database, that 
involved with helping a financial institution create a new service layer on their 
external account creation, transfer funds, ach processing, and fraud detection. 
The service modules created acted as a service layer for their CSR Software, 
Web, and Mobile Applications with a few cron jobs to help with overnight file 
ach processing and other account checks. JUnit Tests were implemented for 
high code coverage and we used RestAssured for E2E Service Tests replacing 
previously used Postman Tests.}`,
